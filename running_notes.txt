docker-compose down

Check if there are any specific environment variables needed?

However, I notice a few potential issues that should be addressed:
The security configuration file (SecurityConfig.java) is missing, which is crucial for proper security setup.
The JWT secret key in application.yml is using a default value, which should be changed in production.
CORS is currently set to allow all origins (*), which might need to be restricted in production.
